## 10 Rendering Patterns for WebApps

1. Static website
- Put all you webpages in advance then upload them as static files into a cloud as aws and point a domain to them.
- Framework suport: Hugo Js, 11ty Js,...

2. Multiple pages apps
- HTML and data put together dynamic on the server whenever request comes in from a browser this means the appearance of the website can change whenever the underlying data changes
- Framework support:RubyOnRail, Lavarel, Django,...

3. Single pages website:
- All the UI rendering on the browser start with HTML as a shell then execue the Js code to render the UI, fetch any data with an additional HTTP request.
- It still have multiple pages those routes dont't  point to the server they just updated by Js in browser
- Framework support: Angular, React,...

4. Server-side rendering with hydration
- Render intial page on server
- MPA + SPA --> SSR
- The general idea is that the inital request goes to a server and rendering anything dynamic then after that inital page load Js take over to give you the app like SPA
- Framework support: NextJs, Nuxtjs,...

5. Static site generation with hydration
- You render your HTML in advance then upload it to a static code like a storage but like SSR it will hydrate to Js after the inital page load
- Rebuild for fresh data --> redeploy anything whenever data changes
- Framwork support: jamstack

6. Increamental static regeneration 
- The idea you deploy a static site but you rebuild invidual pages on the fly on your server when the caches is invalidated normally with static site you can cache everything permanently on a CDN making it extremexly fast

7. Partial Hydration
- You may rendering the component at the top of the page first and wait until the user scroll down before making interactive 
- Tool supoort: viteJs

8. Islands 
- you start with static HTML only use Js to hydrate the interactive component 
- you may have a page not interactive at all in which case no Js is ever ship to the client 
9. Streaming SSR
- It allows you render server-side content can currently in multilpel chunk instead of all at once
- Support: NextJs 13, 

10. Resumability using qwik
- data or js event are serialized into HTML 
- the actualy js code is broken into tons of tiny chunk
